This is an AddOn for World of Warcraft.

It's purpose is to provide two switches to allow you to 'lock' the game client into mouselook mode without having to hold down the right mousebutton (which is how to use mouselook by default in the unmodified game client)  It also causes the mouse buttons to remap to movement (forward and backward) keys to match the configuration found in Dark Age of Camelot.

The Mouselook Toggle switch turns on the lock on.  It works as a toggle.

the Mouselook Momentary switch temporarily returns the pointer and mousebuttons to normal for target selection.  It works as a momentary switch, which means that it only works while you hold down the button.

Both switches are configurable in the Key Bindings screen of the standard WoW client.

As additional features, MouseLook will also automatically return the pointer and mouse buttons to normal anytime there is a window on the screen that needs you to click on it (questlog, auction house, etc)
